# TODO
- Add SAM support for alignements or alignment should be encoded in reads names?
- Add a mutation generator that is based on a VCF file
- Find a syntax for generating a simulated experiment (in YAML if possible)
- We should be able to run the pipeline step separatly if we want
- Output should be compressed to GZIP
- Break the genomeSimulator in more pieces...
